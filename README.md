OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that provides applications
the ability to “secure designated access.” For example, you can tell Facebook that it’s OK
for Spotify to access your profile or post updates to your timeline without having to give
Spotify your Facebook password. This minimizes risk in a major way: In the event, Spotify
suffers a breach, your Facebook password remains safe.

OAuth doesn’t share password data but instead uses authorization tokens to prove an
identity between consumers and service providers. OAuth is an authentication protocol that
allows you to approve one application interacting with another on your behalf without
giving away your password. Further information can be found in the following links:
